### Weather API Endpoints - 

- **Function Name:** `searchApi`
- **Description:** The api endpoint is triggered at the same same time user hit the search button for their desired weather location. When the Url is triggered the user will see weather information of that particular day and place.
- **Endpoint URL:** `https://us-central1-weatherapp-421018.cloudfunctions.net/searchApi?apiKey=${apiKey}&city=${params.cityName}`
- **Usage:**
  - To retrieve weather data on user requested search parameter, make a GET request to the above URL.
  - Example: `curl https://us-central1-weatherapp-421018.cloudfunctions.net/searchApi?apiKey=${apiKey}&city=${params.cityName}`


- **Function Name:** `forCastApi`
